# About
Yarnmancy **WILL BE** a RTS game. Gather sewing resources to build an armor, troops and structures.
The idea was born in 2019, inside a goofy childish atmosphere, a kid builds an entire army on his book.
Mostly this is a project to encourage me to learn English, Git and Programming, i need experience to work and the development is quite fun too.
At the moment, i am on the first steps.
